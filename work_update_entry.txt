Merging of my airflow scheduler, PosgreSQL and pgAdmin with Shreshth's SqlAlchemy, flask servers, routes, models and configurations

6th October

-> Connected pgAdmin and PostgreSQL using a common network connector coded in the compose file.
-> Conflicting issues with the airflow, so now focusing on debugging airflow and getting it back to a healthy state.
-> need to re-write the airflow's yaml code
