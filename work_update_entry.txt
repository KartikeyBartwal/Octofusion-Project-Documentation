Merging of my airflow scheduler, PosgreSQL and pgAdmin with Shreshth's SqlAlchemy, flask servers, routes, models and configurations

6th October

-> Connected pgAdmin and PostgreSQL using a common network connector coded in the compose file.
-> Conflicting issues with the airflow, so now focusing on debugging airflow and getting it back to a healthy state.
-> need to re-write the airflow's yaml code
-> Missed to do this for the .env file:
echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)\nAIRFLOW_GID=0" > .env
-> Using first principles to get every service started, starting from octofusion webserver
-> Fixed the octofusion web-server. Now, we have :

1) Database running (pgAdmin + PostgreSQL)
2) Octofusion web-server running (flask, SqlAlchemcy + remaining frontend part)

All that is left is to make the airflow scheduler run alongside these with proper network and message exachange worth level of connectivity
